# 📊 Data Science Portfolio – Raviteja G

## 👋 About Me
I am a Data Science learner with prior experience in software development (Angular) and enterprise systems (SAP Security).  
After working in an MNC environment, I decided to transition into Data Science & Analytics to build a more data-driven and problem-solving–focused career.

This repository represents my structured learning journey and hands-on projects completed as part of the Simplilearn Data Science Program, along with self-practice and continuous improvement.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Portfolio
This portfolio is designed to:
- Demonstrate strong fundamentals in Data Science  
- Show end-to-end problem-solving, not just code snippets  
- Present work in a clear, reproducible, and professional manner  
- Support applications for Data Analyst / Junior Data Scientist roles
